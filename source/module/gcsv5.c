/*******************************************************************************
 * This file provides functions used by Globus Connect Server v5. 
 *
 * The GCS Manager needs certain information that is only aviailable via the
 * HPSS C API. GCSM could call HPSS functions directly via ctypes but it would
 * run into the tirpc loader issue. So we'll save GCSM the trouble and provide
 * simpler interfaces here. Then GCSM only needs to load the HPSS module and
 * find the function to call. This should work out since the HPSS connector is
 * required for full functionality with HPSS storage gateways.
 *
 * Notes about the functions herein:
 *
 * - Try not to trigger any internal logging
 * - Avoid situations that might hang the query, for example, stale core server
 *   connections or bad usernames
 * - Watch out for deadlocked HPSS API cleanup functions
 * - Send back meaningful error messages to be logged by GCSM
 * - make sure requests are serialized
 * - don't leave connections established or background operations running
 * - we could cache results to make things a bit more efficient
 * - we could skip hpss_PurgeLoginCred() for better performance
 *
 * The code here largely borrows from other functions in the DSI but they are
 * modified to fit our constraints.

/*******************************************************************************
 * get_home_directory()
 *
 *  GCSM needs the user's home directory for expanding path_restrictions when a
 * gridftp login occurs. Historically, the DSI gets the user's home directory
 * from the user credential via the call hpss_GetThreadUcred(). We can not just
 * simply parse passwd/group files because some sites use HPSS LDAP; this call
 * is the only way to get it in all cases.
 *
 * Background:
 * 
 *  HPSS supports 'unix' and 'krb5' for authentication. It supports 'unix' and
 * 'ldap' for authorization. The authentication portion is something we have
 * dealt with for years; the admin configures the DSI to use a specific
 * mechanism which tells the HPSS API how to send the keytab to HPSS. There are
 * even env vars which tell which method is being used (see authenticate.c).
 *
 * Authorization seems to be a little more illusive though. The admin configures
 * the node to use one or the other in /var/hpss/etc/authz.conf. There are no
 * environment variables or configuration options as far as I can tell that hint
 * to which mechanism is in use. This leaves us with all sorts of fun use cases:
 *
 * 1) 'unix' and HPSS_UNIX_USE_SYSTEM_COMMANDS=FALSE: passwd and group live in
 *    ${HPSS_UNIX_AUTH_PASSWD}, defaults to /var/hpss/etc/.
 *
 * 2) 'unix' and HPSS_UNIX_USE_SYSYTEM_COMMANDS=TRUE: passwd and group live in
 *    /etc/ (uses system files). This option is also used when the host OS
 *    uses nis or ldap although HPSS system accounts exist in /etc/passwd.
 *
 * 3) 'ldap': account information is provided through undocumented magic.
 *
 * Since the beginning of this project, we have required that the DTN provide
 * uid/gid translations at the sysytem level, regardless of authorization used,
 * so that gridftp can translate gfs_stat_t entries into username/group.
 * Although gridftp still performs that translation, nothing in the Globus
 * platform actually makes use of the  user or group names. Therefore it's all
 * for not. _But_, we take advantage of the uid/gid translations at system level
 * in order to translate the username to a uid in order to complete the login
 * process. Unfortunatley, that translation does not necessarily have the
 * correct home directory.
