# Something is off with hpss-lib, RPM doesn't seem to know that it provides
# the libraries we require. You can see this with `rpm -q --provides hpss-lib`.
# That command should list the libraries it contains, but it does not list 
# them. Note that this is the the _files_ it contains but rather the
# _capabilities_ is contains, in this case, the libraries. So we use 'AutoReq'
# to disable us from looking for hpss-lib libraries, instead we just check
# that the hpss-lib is installed.
#  For more details: http://ftp.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-depend-auto-depend.html
AutoReq: no

Requires: openssl
# I would prefer to set this equal to @HPSS_MAJOR@.@HPSS_MINOR@ but HPSS version
# comes out like hpss-lib-8.3.0.0-0.el7.x86_64
