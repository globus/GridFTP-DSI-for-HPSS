Version 1.4 Beta:
	- Fix for staged files. Make sure tape SC does not have more bytes
	  than disk SC.
	- Fix for "System error in hpss_Opendir: Too many open files" while
	  doing recursive deletions.
	- Added tape ID to MLST/MLSC/MLSD output are the first portion of
	  the unique attribute. This can be used for intelligent ordering
	  of stage requests.
	- Prevent multiple stage requests for the same file

Version 1.3: Aug 20, 2013
	- Added --with-quota_support which will mark files with UDA so that the
	  NCSA quota system can find them later and fix the account IDs.
	- MLSC, MLSD, LIST no longer wait until all entries have been stat()'ed,
	  instead entries are returned 100 at a time to avoid client timeouts
	- Fixed missing symbol in misc_get_file_size()
	- Fix for files that change size thus change COS
	- CKSM operations are stored and retrieved from HPSS UDA. These are
	  compatible with hpsssum.

Version 1.2 : May 8, 2013
	- Change misc_file_archived() to check for any bytes on disk. Due to holes,
	  we can not expect DataLength to be on disk.
	- Added handling for files with gaps during RETR/CKSM
	- Fixed race condition in gridftp_register_read() which caused a deadlock
	- Throttled the call to globus_ftp_control_data_query_channels() to avoid
	  signal 11
	- Fixed partial checksums deadlock
	- Ordered buffers for RETR in streams mode
	- Another fix for transfer restarts
	- Prevent hang when hpss_PIOExecute() encounters an error
	- Limited gridftp read requests to one at a time to avoid bug GT-296
	- Removed call to globus_gridftp_server_get_optimal_concurrency() during read
	  requests to avoid bug GT-376
	- Fix to pio_data_register_read_callback() to handle large gaps
	- Changed when globus_gridftp_server_begin_transfer() is called when
	  transfers begin in order for the server to more gracefully handle
	  open errors.

Version 1.1 : January 28, 2013
	- Fixed Range Markers with partial stores (ESTO)
	- Fixed transfer restarts
	- Fixed range_list_insert() to correctly insert on the tail
	- Fixed setting of COS on truncated files
	- Added asynchronous message passing
	- Use the system MD5 library which is considerably faster than the
	  HPSS hash functions
	- Fixed a race condition in pio data which caused alarms with error
	  code -50 in HPSS and reported 
	    "system error in hpss_PIOExecute: Input/output error" 
	  through GridFTP.
	- Fix to allow files larger than the COS max file size to be placed
	  into the COS when enforce max file size is disabled.

Version 1.0 : Dec 19, 2012
	- Added fixes sent by Damian Hazen of LBL:
		- Fixed user->home directory mapping to use HPSS LDAP
		- Fixed KRB5 authentication issues
		- Added $HPSS_PATH_ETC/gridftp.conf as new config file location
		- Added gridftp_dsi_hpss_commands.c and header to Makefile.am
	- The search order for the config file is now:
		1) $HPSS_PATH_ETC/gridftp.conf
		2) /var/hpss/etc/gridftp.conf
	- Install directions now include config file setup
	- Fixed config file's AdminList syntax
	- No longer force max segment size in hints
	- Fix for RETR that end early, presumably due to a large segment count
	- Now requires Globus Toolkit 5.2.3rc1 or newer. See 
	  http://jira.globus.org/browse/GT-299
	- Added support for ESTO, ERET, REST (APPE, SCKS not supported yet)
	- Tested against HPSS 7.3.3P7
	- Remove libtool from the distribution
	- Added support for MFMT and SITE UTIME
	- Added support for SITE SYMLINKFROM/SYMLINKTO
	- Added symlink targets to list output
	- Added restart and performance markers in extended block mode
	- Added SETCOS,LSCOS (class of service), SETFAM,LSFAM (tape families)
	- Added project, family, cos and admin settings to the config file
	- Changed '250 Success' messages to '250 OK' to match server.
	- Added 'SITE HARDLINKFROM' and 'SITE HARDLINKTO'
	- Added 'SITE STAGE'. Files that can not be staged because they are on a
	  tape-only class of service will give a special warning.
	- Changed calculation for what is and is not archived. A file must be 
	  completely on a disk SC to be considered not archived.
	- Changed "AR" status in list output to "TP". This should better reflect
	  that some COS are tape only.
	- The list function has been removed until a fully functional version
	  including MLSD and NLST can be implemented.
	- Removed project file configs until those are better understood.
	- Split the DSI into local and control/data components

Version 0.2 Alpha
	- Tested against HPSS 7.4.1B
	- Remove globus_gridftp_server_hpss_data.c
	- [BUG 4] Added check for --with-unixauth or --with-krb5auth
	- [BUG 1] Ported to Globus Toolkit 5.2.1
	- [BUG 6] Fixed gap handling
	- [BUG 8] Fixed SIGABRT on file retrieve
	- [BUG 9] Fixed timestamps in directory listings
	- Changed HPSS API config flags to API_USE_CONFIG
	- Reorganized the stor/retr code
	- Added 'DK'/'AR' archive status to directory listings
	- Listing large directories no longer hangs until the complete listing is
	  ready
	- MLSD is broken
	- Removed config.log, config.status, Makefile and version.h

Version 0.1 Alpha
	- Initial version.
	- Requires Globus Toolkit 5.2.0
	- Tested against HPSS 7.3.3p4
	- Supports only single node transfers (no striping).
	- Hardcoded for unix authentication.
	- No throttling when creating data buffers.
	- COS determined by file size.
	- Very little testing done.
