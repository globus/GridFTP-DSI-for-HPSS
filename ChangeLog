Version 2.12: Tue May 19 22:30:49 EDT 2020

	- Added support for SITE TRNC
	- On STOR, always use O_CREAT in support of S3 transfers
	- DSI version should now be corrected returned to the client on FEAT.

Version 1.8: Tue Jan 20 09:53:20 CST 2015
	- Fixed perf markers, the last marker wasn't being sent
	- Fix for restarts. See patches/perf_restart_markers.README. If you don't
	  understand it, then keep REST disabled (-disable-command-list).
	- Fixed commands handle allocation
	- Work has begun to get PIO onto a specific interface instead of listening
	  on all interfaces. See patches/pio_data_channel.README.

	  exist
	- Updated install guide. Removed references to --with-unixauth and --with_krb5auth.
	  Corrected --with-hpssdir to --with-hpss.
	- Changed access type for "SITE STAGE" to READ so that RETR on readonly sharing
	  works as expected.
	- Fixed permissions on newly created files and directories. Now by default files are
	  created 644 and directories are created 755 but these are also subject
	  to the process's umask setting which can be altered via xinetd.conf.

Version 1.5: Wed May  7 09:39:13 CDT 2014
	- Fixed PIO race condition for transfers that are stopped prematurely.
	- 'Fixed' build to not use globus-makefile-header.
	- Build now expects a 64bit installation
	- Worked around the XDR issue with HPSS 7.4.2, now the DSI only works
	  on Linux (See README.xdr)
	- Separated the source into loaders and module subdirectories (part of
	  the XDR fix)
	- Thanks to the XDR fix, we can now load libhpssunixauth.so and 
	  libhpsskrb5auth.so dynamically. The configure options --with-unixauth
	  and --with-krb5 have been removed.
	- Added --enable-uda_checksum_support to store checksums in UDA for use
	  with HPSS admin tools. Before now, this was not optional.

Version 1.4: Oct 29, 2013
	- Fix for staged files. Make sure tape SC does not have more bytes
	  than disk SC.
	- Fix for "System error in hpss_Opendir: Too many open files" while
	  doing recursive deletions.
	- Added tape ID to MLST/MLSC/MLSD output are the first portion of
	  the unique attribute. This can be used for intelligent ordering
	  of stage requests.
	- Prevent multiple stage requests for the same file

Version 1.3: Aug 20, 2013
	- Added --with-quota_support which will mark files with UDA so that the
	  NCSA quota system can find them later and fix the account IDs.
	- MLSC, MLSD, LIST no longer wait until all entries have been stat()'ed,
	  instead entries are returned 100 at a time to avoid client timeouts
	- Fixed missing symbol in misc_get_file_size()
	- Fix for files that change size thus change COS
	- CKSM operations are stored and retrieved from HPSS UDA. These are
	  compatible with hpsssum.

Version 1.2 : May 8, 2013
	- Change misc_file_archived() to check for any bytes on disk. Due to holes,
	  we can not expect DataLength to be on disk.
	- Added handling for files with gaps during RETR/CKSM
	- Fixed race condition in gridftp_register_read() which caused a deadlock
	- Throttled the call to globus_ftp_control_data_query_channels() to avoid
	  signal 11
	- Fixed partial checksums deadlock
	- Ordered buffers for RETR in streams mode
	- Another fix for transfer restarts
	- Prevent hang when hpss_PIOExecute() encounters an error
	- Limited gridftp read requests to one at a time to avoid bug GT-296
	- Removed call to globus_gridftp_server_get_optimal_concurrency() during read
	  requests to avoid bug GT-376
	- Fix to pio_data_register_read_callback() to handle large gaps
	- Changed when globus_gridftp_server_begin_transfer() is called when
	  transfers begin in order for the server to more gracefully handle
	  open errors.

Version 1.1 : January 28, 2013
	- Fixed Range Markers with partial stores (ESTO)
	- Fixed transfer restarts
	- Fixed range_list_insert() to correctly insert on the tail
	- Fixed setting of COS on truncated files
	- Added asynchronous message passing
	- Use the system MD5 library which is considerably faster than the
	  HPSS hash functions
	- Fixed a race condition in pio data which caused alarms with error
	  code -50 in HPSS and reported 
	    "system error in hpss_PIOExecute: Input/output error" 
	  through GridFTP.
	- Fix to allow files larger than the COS max file size to be placed
	  into the COS when enforce max file size is disabled.

Version 1.0 : Dec 19, 2012
	- Added fixes sent by Damian Hazen of LBL:
		- Fixed user->home directory mapping to use HPSS LDAP
		- Fixed KRB5 authentication issues
		- Added $HPSS_PATH_ETC/gridftp.conf as new config file location
		- Added gridftp_dsi_hpss_commands.c and header to Makefile.am
	- The search order for the config file is now:
		1) $HPSS_PATH_ETC/gridftp.conf
		2) /var/hpss/etc/gridftp.conf
	- Install directions now include config file setup
	- Fixed config file's AdminList syntax
	- No longer force max segment size in hints
	- Fix for RETR that end early, presumably due to a large segment count
	- Now requires Globus Toolkit 5.2.3rc1 or newer. See 
	  http://jira.globus.org/browse/GT-299
	- Added support for ESTO, ERET, REST (APPE, SCKS not supported yet)
	- Tested against HPSS 7.3.3P7
	- Remove libtool from the distribution
	- Added support for MFMT and SITE UTIME
	- Added support for SITE SYMLINKFROM/SYMLINKTO
	- Added symlink targets to list output
	- Added restart and performance markers in extended block mode
	- Added SETCOS,LSCOS (class of service), SETFAM,LSFAM (tape families)
	- Added project, family, cos and admin settings to the config file
	- Changed '250 Success' messages to '250 OK' to match server.
	- Added 'SITE HARDLINKFROM' and 'SITE HARDLINKTO'
	- Added 'SITE STAGE'. Files that can not be staged because they are on a
	  tape-only class of service will give a special warning.
	- Changed calculation for what is and is not archived. A file must be 
	  completely on a disk SC to be considered not archived.
	- Changed "AR" status in list output to "TP". This should better reflect
	  that some COS are tape only.
	- The list function has been removed until a fully functional version
	  including MLSD and NLST can be implemented.
	- Removed project file configs until those are better understood.
	- Split the DSI into local and control/data components

	  ready
	- MLSD is broken
	- Removed config.log, config.status, Makefile and version.h

	- Tested against HPSS 7.3.3p4
	- Supports only single node transfers (no striping).
	- Hardcoded for unix authentication.
	- No throttling when creating data buffers.
	- COS determined by file size.
	- Very little testing done.
